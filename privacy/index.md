Your privacy is critically important to us.

 - We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
 - We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
 - We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact us](mailto:team@uamuzibora.org).

Uamuzi Bora operates the website [uamuzibora.org](https://uamuzibora.org). It is Uamuzi Bora’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Uamuzi Bora collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Uamuzi Bora’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Uamuzi Bora’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Uamuzi Bora may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Uamuzi Bora also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Uamuzi Bora only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Uamuzi Bora’s websites choose to interact with Uamuzi Bora in ways that require Uamuzi Bora to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Uamuzi Bora gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at [uamuzibora.org](https://uamuzibora.org) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Uamuzi Bora are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Uamuzi Bora collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Uamuzi Bora. Uamuzi Bora does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics
Uamuzi Bora may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Uamuzi Bora may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Uamuzi Bora does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Uamuzi Bora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its staff and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Uamuzi Bora’s behalf or to provide services available at Uamuzi Bora’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Uamuzi Bora’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Uamuzi Bora will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its staff and affiliated organizations, as described above, Uamuzi Bora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a court order or other governmental request, or when Uamuzi Bora believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Uamuzi Bora, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Uamuzi Bora website and have supplied your email address, Uamuzi Bora may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Uamuzi Bora. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Uamuzi Bora takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Uamuzi Bora uses cookies to help Uamuzi Bora identify and track visitors, their usage of Uamuzi Bora website, and their website access preferences. Uamuzi Bora visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Uamuzi Bora’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Uamuzi Bora’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers
If Uamuzi Bora, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Uamuzi Bora goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Uamuzi Bora may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Uamuzi Bora may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Uamuzi Bora’s sole discretion. Uamuzi Bora encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
