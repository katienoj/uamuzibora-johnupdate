title: Indicator Dashboard is not working

On 16th April we experienced heavy storms in Kakamega which damaged our radio antenna and connnection to the server. 

While we have now fixed the antenna we are still having problems connecting to the server from the UK. This means we cannot update our indicator dashboard on the website on a daily basis.

We are working to fix the problem as soon as possible and please bear with us.
