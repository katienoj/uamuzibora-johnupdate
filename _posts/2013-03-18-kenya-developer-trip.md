March/April 2013 is a period of major development for Uamuzi Bora. 

Our UK developers, Kenrick Turner and Gunnar RÃ¸, are in Kenya for three weeks to oversee the development and implementation of our new website, as well as [API](/data) and dashboards for aggregating and displaying data for our [HIV](/data/hiv) and [MCH](/data/mch) projects.
