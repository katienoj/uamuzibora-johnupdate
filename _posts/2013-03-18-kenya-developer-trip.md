March/April 2013 is a period of major development for Uamuzi Bora. Our UK Development Leads, Dr Kenrick Turner and Gunnar Ro, are in Kenya for three weeks to oversee the development and implementation of our new website, as well as API and dashboards for aggregating and displaying data for our [HIV](/data/hiv) and [MCH](/data/mch) projects.
