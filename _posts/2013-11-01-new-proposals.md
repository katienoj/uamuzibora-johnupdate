We have prepared new proposals for scale-up and expansion of the HIV and MCH EMRs in 2014. We are currently sharing with our in-country partners and donors and will update on progress soon.

You can download the [HIV EMR proposal] (/resources/proposals/[Uamuzi Bora] HIV EMR Proposal 011113_nobudget.pdf) and [MCH EMR proposal] (/resources/proposals/[Uamuzi Bora] MCH EMR Proposal 011113_nobudget.pdf).
