Today is the last day of programming for the HIV EMR across five sites in Western Kenya.

The HIV EMR has been running continuously for the past 13 months and we are excited about the impact that has been realised during this time.

We will post the final report and findings here soon.

Do get in [touch](/contact) to send any comments or feedback.
