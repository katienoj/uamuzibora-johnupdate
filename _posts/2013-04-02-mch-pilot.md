On 2nd April, Uamuzi Bora, Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Kenya Ministry of Health launched the pilot of a [maternal and child health (MCH)](/projects/mch) electronic medical record (EMR) in Kisumu West district, Western Kenya. The pilot is taking place in five health clinics and will run for three months until the end of June 2013. 

We are excited to be a part of this pioneering implementation, which is a first for Kenya. You can follow the progress of the pilot using the [MCH dashboard](/data/mch).
