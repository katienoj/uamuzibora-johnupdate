title: Introducing SMS reminders

We are delighted to introduce SMS reminders to our programming!

The HIV EMR automatically screens every patient record every 24 hours to review a number of administrative and clinical indicators. We also check to see if any patient has missed their clinic appointment by two weeks and if they have, we send an automated text message reminder to inform them to return to clinic. We also inform every patient one day in advance of their booked clinic appointment.

We only send SMS reminders if the patient has consented to receive them at a previous clinic appointment.

SMS reminders are currently a proof of concept, to show this programming can be integrated into the EMR. There are many other applications of SMS messaging beyond appointment reminders, for example in adherence to ART or awareness of danger signs.

We will further explore the application and implementation of SMS reminders in our programming in 2014.
