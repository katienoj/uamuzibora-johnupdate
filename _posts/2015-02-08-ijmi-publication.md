**Implementation of a cloud-based electronic medical record for maternal and child health in rural Kenya**

Our manuscript entitled _Implementation of a cloud-based electronic medical record for maternal and child health in rural Kenya_ was accepted and published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics on 23 January 2015. 

The article is available online via this [DOI link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.01.005).

The publication highlighted:
+ significant improvements in completeness of the antenatal record through implementation of EMR-based data verification. 
+ a difference of 42.9% in missing data (including screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, malaria, HIV status or ART status of HIV positive women) pre- and post- implementation. 
+ despite significant impact of EMR-based data verification on data completeness, overall screening rates in antenatal care were low.
