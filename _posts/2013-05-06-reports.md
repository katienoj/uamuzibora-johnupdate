We are delighted to introduce HIV and MCH reports to the website!

Simply click on the Reports menu item and choose the [MCH](/reports/mch) or [HIV](/reports/hiv) report. Each report is divided into separate tabs, and each tab displays a table/s of results.

You can select the time period and clinic to generate a customised report.

We hope you enjoy using Reports. Do get in [touch](/contact) to send any comments or feedback.
