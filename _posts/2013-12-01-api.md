Our [Application Programming Interface (API)](/data) provides a powerful means by which data held in the [HIV EMR](/projects/hiv) and [MCH EMR](/projects/mch) databases can be made available for operational research, clinical and administrative verification and reporting.

You can read more about the API and data management procedures [here](/data).

We share our data with selected partners and make use of the API ourselves to generate verification and other reports. We would like to make this service available to other health care providers, researchers or managers - particularly those working in MCH or HIV in Kenya.

Please [contact us](/contact) if you would like to access the databases used in the HIV and MCH EMR.
