We would like to updated you on our API (Application Programming Interface).

The API provides a powerful means by which data held in our HIV and MCH EMR databases can be made available for operational research, clinical and administrative verification and reporting. 

We make use of the API daily to generate verification and other reports and would like to make this service available to other health care providers, researchers or managers - particularly those working in MCH or HIV in Kenya.

If you would like to access the databases used in our HIV and MCH EMR, please get in [touch](/contact).
