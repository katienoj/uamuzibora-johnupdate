**Stage of HIV presentation at initial clinic visit following a community-based HIV testing campaign in rural Kenya**

Our manuscript entitled _Stage of HIV presentation at initial clinic visit following a community-based HIV testing campaign in rural Kenya_ was accepted and published in BMC Public Health on 21 January 2015.

The article is available online via this [DOI link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-1367-4).

The publication highlighted:
+ the community-based integrated prevention campaign (IPC) in 2008 identified HIV positive individuals earlier in the course of HIV infection, compared to Voluntary Counselling and Testing services. 
+ community-based campaigns, such as the IPC, may be able to assist countries to achieve earlier testing and initiation of ART in the course of HIV infection. 
+ improving referral mechanisms and strengthening linkages between HIV testing and treatment services remain a challenge and electronic medical record (EMR) systems may support monitoring of patients throughout the HIV care and treatment continuum.
