With the support of [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) we have developed a free, open source maternal and child health (MCH) [electronic medical record (EMR)](/projects/mch/demo), based on [OpenMRS](http://www.openmrs.org), to improve care and support for pregnant women during antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care. 

We are working with the [Ministry of Health](www.publichealth.go.ke) and [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) to pilot the MCH EMR in five health clinics in Western Kenya. Around 1,000 pregnant women will be enrolled and followed during the pilot period.

You can [try the demo](/projects/mch/demo) of the MCH EMR and [see how we are doing](/data/mch).
