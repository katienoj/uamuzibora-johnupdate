We worked with the [Ministry of Health](www.health.go.ke) and [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) to pilot an MCH EMR in five health clinics in Western Kenya.

Try the [MCH EMR demo](/projects/mch/demo) and view the [MCH indicator dashboard](/data/mch).

The MCH EMR pilot was conducted between April and June 2013. During this time:

+ 946 women, 206 deliveries and 302 children were enrolled+ Average age of pregnant women was 23.6 years+ Average of 1.9 clinic visits were attended per pregnant woman+ 0.2%, 4.7% and 14.0% of women were confirmed TB, Malaria and HIV positive+ 50.4% HIV positive women were receiving ART during pregnancy+ EMR verification of data reduced missing data by 66.3%
