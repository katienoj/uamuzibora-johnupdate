title: Operational Research
---

## Our work follows best practice and evidence-based guidelines written by national and international bodies, including the national Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation.

Our current operational research plan is to implement an electronic medical record (EMR) within the national health system, act as a pilot and provide proof of concept for national EMR implementation and scale-up, and work in partnership with Ministry of Health and other national institutions.

###Overall Aim
To determine whether our projects can strengthen pathways of care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV in Western Kenya

###Specific Objectives
To compare the following indicators in clinics using the electronic medical record (EMR) and those that do not:
1. early diagnosis (rate of provider-initiated testing and WHO clinical stage of infection at first clinic appointment)
2. linkage to care (referral time to HIV care and support from testing)
3. provision of national standards of care (completion of clinical algorithms, clinical and laboratory monitoring)
4. adherence to treatment (rate of failure of first line therapy, disease progression, incidence of opportunistic infection)
5. retention in care (rate of default for clinic appointment)
