We developed an electronic Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm for use with mobile information technology to standardise diagnosis and treatment of children under five.

We are implementing this work in ten child under five outpatient clinics throughout Western Kenya.

More than 6,000 consultations have been recorded using the electronic algorithm and we are currently undertaking operational research to determine its impact on provision of clinical care.
