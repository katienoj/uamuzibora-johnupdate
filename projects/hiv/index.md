<p>We work with the <a href="http://www.health.go.ke">Ministry of Health</a> and <a href="http://www.nascop.go.ke">National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP)</a> to strengthen pathways of HIV care for more than 17,000 patients who are enrolled in two hospitals and three health clinics in Western Kenya.</p>

<p>We completed our HIV EMR programming at the end of November 2013, with significant impact in programming between November 2012 - November 2013:</p>

<ul>
  <li>17,145 patients registered</li>
  <li>79.6% increase in patients eligible but not on ART, who started ART (880 patients)</li>
  <li>3,336 patients now on ART (50.6% increase)</li>
  <li>4,493 patients previously lost to follow up have been traced (100% increase)</li>
  <li>1,312 patients previously lost to follow up have returned to care</li>
  <li>90.1% reduction in missing first CD4 count among patient records</li>
  <li>82.3% reduction in missing first WHO stage among patient records</li>
</ul>
