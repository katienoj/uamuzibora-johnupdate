With the support of [Vestergaard Frandsen](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com) and [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) we have developed a free, open source HIV [electronic medical record (EMR)](/projects/hiv/demo), based on [OpenMRS](http://www.openmrs.org), to improve care and support for people living with HIV.

We work with the [Ministry of Health](http://www.publichealth.go.ke) and [National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP)](http://www.nascop.go.ke) to strengthen pathways of HIV care for more than 13,000 patients who are enrolled in two hospitals and four health clinics in Western Kenya.
