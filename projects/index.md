<p class="lead">We develop and implement mobile information technology and an electronic medical record to make real-time health information available at different levels of the health service to improve clinical and public health decision-making.</p>

_The [HIV](/projects/hiv)  and [Maternal and Child Health](/projects/mch) EMR work supports:_

 1. **Data verification** - to improve the completeness and accuracy of the patient record by running automated database queries every 24 hours and by enabling health records clerks to identify and update incomplete records.

 2. **Clinical decision support** - to verify clinical standards in every patient record every 24 hours and to support clinicians during consultations through the use of clinical decision support.

 3. **Follow up** - to identify patients who have exited care and ensure they are contacted, by SMS reminder and by phone call, to support return to clinic and retention in care.

 4. **Reporting** - to create standardised reports for the Ministry of Health that can be accessed at clinic, district, provincial and national levels to inform public health and clinical decision making.


_The [Child Health](/projects/child) mobile IT work supports:_

 1. **Clinical decision support** - to follow Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm using mobile information technology to standardise diagnosis and treatment at child under five outpatient clinics.
