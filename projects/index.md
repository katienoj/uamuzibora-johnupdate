<p class="lead">We support the <a href="http://www.publichealth.go.ke">Ministry of Health</a> and partners in Kenya to implement mobile information technology and an electronic medical record for <a href="/projects/hiv">HIV</a> and <a href="/projects/mch">Maternal and Child Health</a>.</p>

Our EMR supports four key functions:

 1. **Data verification** - to improve the completeness and accuracy of the patient record by running automated database queries and by enabling health records clerks to identify and update incomplete records.

 2. **Clinical reminders** - to support clinicians during consultations through the use of clinical decision support.

 3. **Follow up** - to identify patients who have exited care and ensure they are contacted, either by SMS reminder or by phone call, to support return to clinic and retention in care.

 4. **Reporting** - to create standardised reports for the Ministry of Health that can be accessed at clinic, district, provincial and national levels to improve the quality, completeness and timeliness of reporting.
