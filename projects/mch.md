With the support of [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/), the [Ministry of Health, Kenya](www.publichealth.go.ke) and [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) we have developed a maternal and child health (MCH) [electronic medical record (EMR)](/projects/mch/demo), based on [OpenMRS](http://www.openmrs.org), to improve care and support for pregnant women during antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care in Western Kenya. 

The MCH EMR replicates the MCH handbook that all pregnant women receive during pregnancy in Kenya. We are working in five health clinics in Western Kenya to pilot this program and anticipate around 1,000 pregnant women will be enrolled and followed during the pilot period.
