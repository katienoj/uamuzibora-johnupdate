<p class="lead">We follow evidence-based guidelines written by national and international bodies, including the Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation.</p>

We aim to provide health information that can improve clinical and public health decision making. We are currently conducting our own operational research to determine whether an electronic medical record can strengthen pathways of care and improve health outcomes.
