<p class="lead">We support education and training for Ministry of Health staff and partners at all levels of the health service</p>

We conduct regular training for Ministry of Health staff who use the mobile information technology and electronic medical record, including clinicians, nurses, clinical officers, counsellors and health records clerks. Our team act as mentors with clinic staff and ensure the system is integrated into administrative and clinical activities.

We train Ministry of Health management teams at district, provincial and national levels to make better use of health information, through the generation of standardised reports and indicator dashboards. We aim to provide health information that can improve clinical and public health decision making.
