<p class="lead">Uamuzi Bora was founded in 2009...</p>

In September 2008, nearly 50,000 people attended a community-based campaign of HIV testing in Western Kenya, linked with the distribution of a preventive care package called [CarePack](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/carepack). Nearly 2,000 people tested positive for HIV. The campaign was funded by [Vestergaard-Frandsen](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com) and implemented in partnership with the [Ministry of Health, Kenya](http://www.publichealth.go.ke).

#### But testing positive for HIV is only the start of a long journey...

There was a huge need to ensure these people who tested positive for HIV were followed-up adequately and referred to care and support services. Back in the UK, we started the design of an electronic medical record (EMR) that could aid follow-up and referral of people from testing, to clinic and through the lifelong care and support required for people living with HIV.

In 2009, we re-visited Kenya and installed the first version of the [EMR](/projects/hiv/demo) in the HIV clinic in Kakamega Provincial General Hospital. We also trained the staff in how to use the system and gathered feedback after a trial period of use.

In 2010, we returned to update the system, complete data entry of patient records into the database and continue the training of staff. Now we had registered not just those patients who tested positive from the CarePack campaign but ALL patients registered at the hospital. We registered nearly 8,000 patients in the system and it was used to support provision of outpatient HIV care in the hospital for a further two years.

#### And there was more that we could do...

In 2012, we received a grant from [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) to continue to develop the EMR and to expand to other clinics in Western Kenya. We migrated the EMR to the [OpenMRS platform](http://www.openmrs.org), to ensure all data adhered to common national and international standards.

In 2013, more than 13,000 HIV patients are registered in the EMR, which is implemented in two hospitals and four health clinics, and it is proving to be a valuable tool for clinicians, public health officers and researchers in both Kenya and the UK. The EMR is helping to monitor all aspects of HIV outpatient care, from testing, adherence to therapy and retention in care and has been selected as a pilot for a future national program.

The grant from [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) has also enabled us to partner with the [Ministry of Health, Kenya](http://www.publichealth.go.ke) and [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) to pilot the implementation of a Maternal and Child Health (MCH) EMR in five clinics in Western Kenya.
