### Grand Challenges Canada
We are recipients of a Round 3 Rising Stars in Global Health grant from [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) that has enabled us to continue to develop the [HIV EMR](/projects/hiv) and to expand to other clinics in Western Kenya. The grant has also enabled us to pilot the implementation of a [Maternal and Child Health (MCH) EMR](/projects/mch) in five clinics in Western Kenya.

### Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
We are working in partnership with the [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) to pilot the implementation of a [Maternal and Child Health (MCH) EMR](/projects/mch) in five clinics in Western Kenya.

### Ministry of Health, Kenya
We work in partnership with the Kenya [Ministry of Health](http://www.publichealth.go.ke) and [National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP)](http://www.nascop.go.ke) and adhere to national standards and pathways of care. The [HIV EMR](/projects/hiv) has been selected as a pilot for a future national EMR and will provide a proof of concept for future scale-up and implementation.

### Vestergaard Frandsen
[Vestergaard-Frandsen](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com) provided initial funding to develop and implement the EMR in 2009, following a community-based campaign of HIV testing that took place in Western Kenya. You can read more of our story [here](/about/story).
