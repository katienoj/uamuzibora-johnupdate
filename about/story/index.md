<p class="lead">Uamuzi Bora was founded in 2009 to address gaps in referral from HIV testing to care. Today we are a pilot programme for a national electronic medical record, improving care for more than 17,000 patients.</p>

In 2008, 50,000 people attended a community-based campaign of HIV testing in Western Kenya, linked with the distribution of a preventive care package called [CarePack](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com/carepack), and nearly 2,000 people tested positive for HIV. The campaign was funded by [Vestergaard Frandsen](http://www.vestergaard-frandsen.com) and implemented in partnership with the [Ministry of Health in Kenya](http://www.publichealth.go.ke).

> "Testing positive for HIV is only the start of a long journey"

There was a need to ensure those who tested HIV positive were followed up and referred to care and support services. Back in the UK, we designed an electronic medical record (EMR) that could support follow up and referral of people from testing, to clinic and through the lifelong care and support needed.

In 2009, we implemented the first version of the [EMR](/projects/hiv/demo) in Kakamega Provincial General Hospital and enrolled all patients who tested HIV positive from the CarePack campaign.

In 2010, we returned to update the system and enrolled _all_ HIV patients registered at the hospital. We enrolled nearly 8,000 patients and supported the provision of care in the hospital for a further two years.

> "Donâ€™t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible."

In 2012, we received a grant from [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) to continue to develop the EMR and expand to other clinics. We migrated the system to [OpenMRS](http://www.openmrs.org) to ensure all data adhered to national and international standards.

At the end of 2013, more than 17,000 HIV patients are registered in the EMR, which is implemented in two hospitals and three health clinics. 

We are helping to monitor all aspects of [HIV care](/projects/hiv), from testing, adherence to therapy and retention in care and we have been selected as a pilot for a future national system.

The grant from [Grand Challenges Canada](http://www.grandchallenges.ca/) has also enabled us to partner with the [Ministry of Health](http://www.publichealth.go.ke) and [Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA)](http://www.jica.org) to pilot the implementation of a [Maternal and Child Health (MCH) EMR](/projects/mch) in five clinics in Western Kenya.
