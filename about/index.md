<p class="lead">We are a UK charity working to improve public health and primary care in Kenya.</p>

Uamuzi Bora means _a better choice_ in Luhya, a local language spoken in Western Kenya, and was chosen by the local communities to describe the work we do.

We believe the delivery of primary health care can be improved through the use of information technology and an electronic medical record, particularly in resource constrained settings such as Kenya.

We work with the [Ministry of Health](http://www.publichealth.go.ke) in Kenya to strengthen pathways of care and support, including linkage to care, clinical decision support, adherence to treatment and retention in care.

We hope you enjoy reading about [our work](/projects).
