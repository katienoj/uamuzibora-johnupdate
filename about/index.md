<p class="lead">We believe health care can be improved through better access and use of health information.</p>

Uamuzi Bora means _a better choice_ in Swahili and was chosen by the local communities to describe the work we do.

We develop and implement mobile information technology and an electronic medical record to make real-time health information available at different levels of the health service to improve clinical and public health decision-making. 

We work with the [Ministry of Health](http://www.health.go.ke) in Kenya to implement these innovative technologies for HIV and Maternal and Child Health. We are seeing significant improvements in provision of clinical care and public health and we hope you enjoy reading about [our work](/projects).
