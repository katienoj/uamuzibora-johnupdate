# Welcome to Uamuzi Bora!

## We are Uamuzi Bora, a medical project working to improve primary health care in Western Kenya.

Uamuzi Bora means _a better choice_ in Luhya, a local language spoken in Western Kenya, where we work, and was chosen by the local communities to describe the work we do.

We believe the delivery of primary health care can be improved through the use of information technology and an electronic medical record, particularly in resource constrained settings such as Western Kenya.

We work with the [Ministry of Health](www.publichealth.go.ke) in Kenya to strengthen existing pathways of primary health care and support, using mobile information technology and an electronic medical record, to improve linkage to care, clinical decision support, adherence to treatment and retention in care.

We hope you enjoy the website and learning more about our [work](/projects). You can read our [story](/about/story) here.
