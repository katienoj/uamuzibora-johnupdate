<p class="lead">A diverse set of individuals make up Uamuzi Bora from locations such as Kenya, the UK and Norway. Whether they're involved as employees or as volunteers, we work seemlessly from different continents to make a difference.</p>

<h3>Kenya Team</h3>
<p>Our clinical team work directly in HIV and MCH clinics in Western Kenya, liasing with both clinicians and medical records staff to help enter data and use the EMR system effectively.</p>

		<p>In 1964, Kenrick Turner was sent to jail for a crime he did not commit. He promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and today remains at large in the Los Angeles underground. If you have a problem, and if you can find him, you should call... the A Team. [Cue music]</p>

<h3>Development Team</h3>
<p>The development team split their time between Europe and field trips to Kenya, and are responsible for developing all aspects of the EMR system from hardware and infrastructure choices through to user interface design.</p>

		<p>Kenrick is a medical doctor based in the UK. He co-founded the project with John in 2009 and continues to work on it in a volunteer capacity. He mainly works on the user interface side of things, and telling John what isn't possible and then usually proving himself wrong.</p>
